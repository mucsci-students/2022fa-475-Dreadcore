# Note to reviewers: when in spider mode there maybe some bugs: when returning to the body some weird things have a chance of happening such as getting stuck etc. Pressing F a couple times until the game returns you back to the body seems to fix it. There is also a weird text bug with the interact button, there will be a button within the game press E to interact with it.

# Tips

- If you see an area you can't get to, you'll need an upgrade to go there.
- Press H to use a battery and heal. You start out with 3. But there are 2 others hidden throughout the map. Collecting a battery will increase your maximum capacity by

- Mac users: download and unzip. Allow the file to be executed by changing directory with cd Mac.app/Contents/MacOS. Then run chmod +x Dreadcore. Do ./Dreadcore and got denied by the MacOS antivirus. Went to System Preferences -> Security & Preferences -> General. Then clicked open anyway at the bottom which came up with a popup where I had to click run anyway. (Thank you Justin Stevens!)

# Post-release updates

Update 1.1:
- Mac build is now available! (Although none of us have Macs to test it out, so hopefully it works.)
- Fixed a bug where spider mode would occasionally get stuck in a building while returning to torso.
- Fixed a bug where the Dreadcore (A.K.A. the boss) would not breathe fire in phase 2.
- Increased the Dreadcore's health to prevent players from killing it while it's transitioning into phase 2.
- Increased the number of platforms next to the Dreadcore, to allow players to have SOME breathing room.
