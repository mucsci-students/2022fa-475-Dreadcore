## Tips
- There are no death pits in this game. Don't be afraid to jump down and explore to your heart's content.
- If you see an area you can't get to, you'll need an upgrade to go there.
- Press H to use a battery and heal. You start out with 3. But there are 2 others hidden throughout the map. Collecting a battery will increase your maximum capacity by +1
- F key and left shift are used regarding spider mode. F will allow you to morph and return back to player, left shift for wall dropping.

# Review this version (1.0): Download windows + mac files included: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0l8sH0S4BXuKFDhywwD0ycVBZwa9GV9/view?usp=share_link
- Windows users: download and unzip, use windows folder, and run the executeable.
- Mac users: download and unzip. Allow the file to be executed by changing directory with cd Mac.app/Contents/MacOS. Then run chmod +x Dreadcore. Do ./Dreadcore and got denied by the MacOS antivirus. Went to System Preferences -> Security & Preferences -> General. Then clicked open anyway at the bottom which came up with a popup where I had to click run anyway. (Thank you Justin Stevens!)

### Post-release Patch Notes
- Just a reminder, if you're in CSCI 475, _**DO NOT REVIEW THE UPDATES!**_ They were released after the due date, and it wouldn't be fair if these were reviewed. These updates are purely for fun. So after writing the review for 1.0, feel free to enjoy! :)

###### **Update 1.1:**
- Fixed a bug where spider mode would occasionally get stuck in a building while returning to torso.
- Fixed a bug where the Dreadcore (A.K.A. the boss) would not breathe fire in phase 2.
- Increased the Dreadcore's health to prevent players from killing it while it's transitioning into phase 2.
- Increased the number of platforms next to the Dreadcore, to allow players to have SOME breathing room.

###### **Update 1.1.2 - Prepare to Die!**
- Made some UI changes. Particularly the death screen. You'll find that it's a lot more Souls-like!
- Made it so the boss's health resets every time you die. Now you'll actually have to git gud! >:)
- Added 2 Mega Dragon Sentries at the top of the boss room. This'll prevent players from staying in 1 spot for too long.

###### **Update 1.1.3:**
- Fixed an exploit where the Dragon Sentries would permanently shut off when the player activates Spider Mode while in the turret's range, leaves the Sentry attack zone while in Spider Mode, and then returns to torso.
- A prompt now shows up at the beginning of the game, telling the player how to heal.
- Made the super janky staircase, right before the spider mode upgrade, slightly less janky.

###### **Update 1.2:**
- Made Zulikoth prettier.
- Edited the dragon turret attack zones to prevent cheesing the boss in the corner of the map.
- Fixed an issue where 0 health still showed up as a sliver of health on all health bars.
- Put the boss health bar at the bottom of the screen, like a Souls boss.
- Changed the healing button from H to Q.
- Fixed an issue where healing restored all of your health in Talakor, and 25% of your health in Zulikoth. Now it restores 25% of your health in both locations. 
- Made the battery icon bigger.
- Each location briefly displays its name while spawning into it.
- Changed the UI sounds to be more sci-fi.
