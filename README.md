# Note to reviewers: when in spider mode there maybe some bugs: when returning to the body some weird things have a chance of happening such as getting stuck etc. Pressing F a couple times until the game returns you back to the body seems to fix it. There is also a weird text bug with the interact button, there will be a button within the game press E to interact with it.

# Tips
- There are no death pits in this game. Don't be afraid to jump down and explore to your heart's content.
- If you see an area you can't get to, you'll need an upgrade to go there.

# Post-release updates

Update 1.1:
- Fixed a bug where spider mode would occasionally get stuck in a building while returning to torso.
- Fixed a bug where the Dreadcore (A.K.A. the boss) would not breathe fire in phase 2.
- Increased the Dreadcore's health to prevent players from killing it while it's transitioning into phase 2.
- Increased the number of platforms next to the Dreadcore, to allow players to have SOME breathing room.
