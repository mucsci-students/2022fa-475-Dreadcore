# Developed by Matt Giacoponello, Austin An, Trevor Bender

# Creator of Player sprite and music (besides main menu theme): Matt Giacoponello

# Note to reviewers:
- CONTROLS ARE INSIDE OF THE OPTIONS MENU YOU CAN ENTER THE OPTIONS SCREEN DURING THE MAIN MENU, AND PAUSING (ESCAPE KEY) THE GAME AND CLICKING OPTIONS. 
- If you get stuck please check out our discord channel #group4-discussion, there are some helpful videos that may cover two spots players may likely get stuck.  However we will answer any questions you guys have if theres anything else!
There is also a weird text bug with the interact button, there will be a button within the game press E to interact with it.
- If stuck after using spider mode keep pressing F to return to the players body.
- Weird bug happens with the message for interacting with the portal button in the game, sometimes it pops up sometimes it doesn't. Press E on the button to activate it.

# Tips
- There are no death pits in this game. Don't be afraid to jump down and explore to your heart's content.
- If you see an area you can't get to, you'll need an upgrade to go there.
- Press H to use a battery and heal. You start out with 3. But there are 2 others hidden throughout the map. Collecting a battery will increase your maximum capacity by +1
- F key and left shift are used regarding spider mode. F will allow you to morph and return back to player, left shift for wall dropping.

# Download windows + mac files included: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ofqP-75mj-lZB5YoECzppHDQWqoGOdDZ/view?usp=share_link
- Windows users: download folder, unzip, use windows folder and run the executeable.
- Mac users: download and unzip. Allow the file to be executed by changing directory with cd Mac.app/Contents/MacOS. Then run chmod +x Dreadcore. Do ./Dreadcore and got denied by the MacOS antivirus. Went to System Preferences -> Security & Preferences -> General. Then clicked open anyway at the bottom which came up with a popup where I had to click run anyway. (Thank you Justin Stevens!)

# Post-release updates

Update 1.1:
- Mac build is now available! (Although none of us have Macs to test it out, so hopefully it works.)
- Fixed a bug where spider mode would occasionally get stuck in a building while returning to torso.
- Fixed a bug where the Dreadcore (A.K.A. the boss) would not breathe fire in phase 2.
- Increased the Dreadcore's health to prevent players from killing it while it's transitioning into phase 2.
- Increased the number of platforms next to the Dreadcore, to allow players to have SOME breathing room.
