# Tips
- There are no death pits in this game. Don't be afraid to jump down and explore to your heart's content.
- If you see an area you can't get to, you'll need an upgrade to go there.
- Press H to use a battery and heal. You start out with 3. But there are 2 others hidden throughout the map. Collecting a battery will increase your maximum capacity by +1
- F key and left shift are used regarding spider mode. F will allow you to morph and return back to player, left shift for wall dropping.

# Version 1.1.3: This update is currently only on Windows. Go here to download it. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TVtRGFoJreCnHyjUOxjaClDaUH2YFiIi/view?usp=share_link
- The Mac build will be available in the near future.

# Version 1.1: Download windows + mac files included: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ofqP-75mj-lZB5YoECzppHDQWqoGOdDZ/view?usp=share_link
- Windows users: download folder, unzip, use windows folder and run the executeable.
- Mac users: download and unzip. Allow the file to be executed by changing directory with cd Mac.app/Contents/MacOS. Then run chmod +x Dreadcore. Do ./Dreadcore and got denied by the MacOS antivirus. Went to System Preferences -> Security & Preferences -> General. Then clicked open anyway at the bottom which came up with a popup where I had to click run anyway. (Thank you Justin Stevens!)

# Post-release patch notes

Update 1.1:
- Mac build is now available! (Although none of us have Macs to test it out, so hopefully it works.)
- Fixed a bug where spider mode would occasionally get stuck in a building while returning to torso.
- Fixed a bug where the Dreadcore (A.K.A. the boss) would not breathe fire in phase 2.
- Increased the Dreadcore's health to prevent players from killing it while it's transitioning into phase 2.
- Increased the number of platforms next to the Dreadcore, to allow players to have SOME breathing room.

Update 1.1.2 - Prepare to Die!
- Made some UI changes. Particularly the death screen. You'll find that it's a lot more Souls-like!
- Made it so the boss's health resets every time you die. Now you'll actually have to git gud! >:)
- Added 2 Mega Dragon Sentries at the top of the boss room. This'll prevent players from staying in 1 spot for too long.

Update 1.1.3
- Fixed an exploit where the Dragon Sentries would permanently shut off when the player activates Spider Mode while in the turret's range, leaves the Sentry attack zone while in Spider Mode, and then returns to torso.
- A prompt now shows up at the beginning of the game, telling the player how to heal.
- Made the super janky staircase, right before the spider mode upgrade, slightly less janky.
