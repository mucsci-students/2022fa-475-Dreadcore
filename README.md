# Note to reviewers: when in spider mode there maybe some bugs: when returning to the body some weird things have a chance of happening such as getting stuck etc. Pressing F a couple times until the game returns you back to the body seems to fix it. There is also a weird text bug with the interact button, there will be a button within the game press E to interact with it.
